The lyrics to Play it Again are 
"She was sittin' all alone over on the tailgate
Tan legs swingin' by a Georgia plate
I was lookin' for her boyfriend,
Thinkin', "No way she ain't got one."
Soon as I sat down I was fallin' in love
Tryin' to pour a little sugar in her Dixie cup
Talkin' over the speakers in the back of that truck
She jumped up and cut me off

She was like, "Oh, my God, this is my song.
I've been listenin' to the radio all night long.
Sittin' 'round, waitin' for it to come on and here it is."
She was like, "Come here boy, I wanna dance."
'Fore I said a word she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' me around 'til it faded out
And she gave me a kiss
And she said, "Play it again, play it again, play it again."
And I said, "Play it again, play it again, play it again."

I'd gave that DJ my last dime
If he would have played it just one more time
But a little while later we were sittin' in the drive in my truck
Before I walked her to the door
I was scannin' like a fool AM, FM, XM, too
But I stopped real quick when I heard that groove
Man, you should have seen her light up

She was like, "Oh, my God, this is my song.
We've been listenin' to the radio all night long.
I can't believe that it came back on, but here it is."
She was like, "Come here boy, I wanna dance."
'Fore I said a word she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' in the headlights she gave me a goodnight kiss
And I said, "Play it again, play it again, play it again."
And she said, "Play it again, play it again, play it again."

The next Friday night
We were sittin' out under the stars
You should have seen her smile
When I broke out my guitar

She was like, "Oh my God, this is my song.
I've been listenin' to the radio all night long.
Sittin' 'round, waitin' for it to come on and here it is."
She was like, "Come here boy, I wanna dance."
'Fore I said a word she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' in the headlights she gave me a goodnight kiss
And she said, "Play it again, play it again, play it again."
And I said, "Play it again, play it again, play it again."

Yeah, play it again, play it again, play it again
Somebody, play it again, play it again, play it again"

Lyrics to Drunk on You "Cottonwood fallin' like snow in July
Sunset, riverside, 4 wheel drives
In a tail light circle

Roll down the windows, turn it on up
Pour a little crown in a Dixie cup
Get the party started

[Chorus:]
Girl, you make my speakers go boom boom
Dancin' on the tailgate in a full moon
That kinda thing makes a man go mmm hmmm
You're lookin' so good in what's left of those blue jeans
Drip of honey on the money maker gotta be
The best buzz I'm ever gonna find
Hey, I'm a little drunk on you
And high on summertime

If you ain't a 10 you're a 9.9
Tippin' n' spillin' that home-made wine
On your tied up T-shirt

Every little kiss is drivin' me wild
Throwin' little cherry bombs into my fire
Good god almighty

[Chorus:]
Girl, you make my speakers go boom boom
Dancin' on the tailgate in a full moon
That kinda thing makes a man go mmm hmmm
You're lookin' so good in what's left of those blue jeans
Drip of honey on the money maker gotta be
The best buzz I'm ever gonna find
Hey, I'm a little drunk on you
And high on summertime

Let's slip on out where it's a little bit darker
And when it gets a little bit hotter
We'll take it off on out in the water

[Chorus:]
Girl, you make my speakers go boom boom
Dancin' on the tailgate in a full moon
That kinda thing makes a man go mmm hmmm
You're lookin' so good in what's left of those blue jeans
Drip of honey on the money maker gotta be
The best buzz I'm ever gonna find
Hey, I'm a little drunk on you
And high on summertime

Yeah, I'm a little drunk on you"
